## Release 0.2.0

We are pleased to announce the release of CubeViz, a visualization and analysis tool for data cubes from integral field units (IFUs). This is an early release (v0.2.0) and we would appreciate your feedback.  It is built on top of the "glue" visualization tool.

To install:
  * Install [Minconda3](https://conda.io/miniconda.html) if it is not on your system
  * To install, type: `$ conda create -n cubeviz020 -c glueviz cubeviz`
  
To run:
  * Activate the environment: `$ source activate cubeviz020`
  * Run cubeviz: `$ cubeviz`
  * Once done, deactivate the environment: `source deactivate`

More installation instructions will be on the RTD page (currently incorrectly displaying the wrong docs and appears to be an RTD bug).
